This is a great way to learn about Distributed Systems. You can code along at home, and build your own video-to-MP3 file converter app. Along the way, you'll learn some MongoDB, Kubernetes, and MySQL. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microservices-and-software-system-design-course/\\n TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript.

        "body": "Here are this week's five links that are worth your time:\\n 1. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages on Earth right now. In science, in industry, and in high school robotics clubs around the world. You, too, can learn to wield this mighty Python power. I'm sick as a dog as I type this, so if what I'm saying sounds silly, it's probably the NyQuil talking. freeCodeCamp has published dozens of Python video courses, but this week I wanted to share something for the folks who prefer good old fashion book learning. (full-length book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-book/\\n 2. Ah. Graph Algorithms. The bane of every coding interview prepper. These powerful programming patterns are over-represented in job interview questions, so you'll want to eventually learn them well. This course will help you grok Depth-First Traversal, Breadth-First Traversal, Shortest Path, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. This Dijkstra guy, he's kind of a big deal. More on him later.\\n (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-graph-algorithms-work/\\n 3. User Interface VS User Experience – what's the difference, you might ask? Well, User Interfaces have been around since the industrial revolution. Think the control room of a power station, or the cockpit of a plane. But User Experience – that's a more recent way of thinking about Human-Computer Interaction. The term was coined in the 1990s by a designer and cognitive psychologist at Apple. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp instructor Dionysia Lemonaki will explain the distinctions between the two and their shared history. She'll also walk you through the UX Design Process.
